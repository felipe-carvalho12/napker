                            MARK ZUCKERBERG: Well, yeah. I think in a lot of ways, over the last few years, we have changed, significantly, how we've run the company. We are, you know, dealing with a lot of major social issues, right, everything from policing harmful content, to protecting the integrity of elections, to making sure that data privacy controls are strong. And the big journey that we've been on, over the last few years, is really getting much more proactive about seeking out where there might be issues and making sure we're investing appropriately to handle them. You know, we now are doing way more on each of those fronts, in order to identify issues that come up and get ahead.

                        STEPHANOPOULOS: The issues keep coming. Even as we were just about to sit down,
                        I got a bulletin from Bloomberg News. I'll pull it up right now.
                        It says that "Facebook user data is still showing up in places it shouldn't.
                        Researchers at a cybersecurity firm found troves of user information hiding in plain sight,"
                        apparently, millions of records on the Amazon cloud. Are we going to keep seeing surprises like this?

                        ZUCKERBERG: Well, I just saw that. So we're still looking into this.
                        And you know, in general, we work with developers to make sure that
                        they're respecting people's information and using it in only ways that they want.
                        But one of the reasons why I started -- why I wrote this op-ed, over the weekend,
                        around areas where I think regulation would be helpful.
                        Where it would be useful to spell out clearly what the responsibilities
                        that we want companies and people and governments to have are, I think, as we work
                        through a lot of these issues, there are a lot of decisions that I just think people
                        don't want a single private company to be making, right? So for example...
